# Nitrogen-Linux
Performance, Simplified
I made Nitrogen Linux based on Arch Linux with a focus on performance

x86-64 vs x86-64-v3/x86-64-v4
x86-64 is kinda old, so now we have x86-64-v2/v3/v4 which each give a better performance, but that comes with a problem, x86-64-v4 isnt compatible with most hardware, so x86-64-v3 is the best version, but if you have a newer processor(tried on an 11th gen intel i5) x86-64-v4 will usually work better.
